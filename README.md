## Timeline

### Prototype Stage (DUE DATE: October 30th, 2018):
	
1. Creating a basic smart contract
2. Starting to build and understand the structure of the program
3. Sandboxed testing of basic smart contract
4. Blog post about prototype process (Pushed to next sprint)
5. Blog post about looping/recursive mechanism in Solidity (Implemented recursive factorial, writing post pushed to next sprint)

### Implementation Stage (DUE DATE: November 19th, 2018):

1. Implementing the voting ballot
2. Counting all votes
3. Reporting a winner
4. Ensuring users are confidential
5. Ensuring there canâ€™t double vote
6. Understanding how this confidentiality is baked into Solidity and the blockchain
7. A couple blog posts about implementation process

### Testing Stage (DUE DATE: December 7th, 2018):
	
1. Test the program
2. Fix any outstanding bugs
3. Implement finishing touches
4. Blog post about testing process
5. Final blog post about Solidity and project
